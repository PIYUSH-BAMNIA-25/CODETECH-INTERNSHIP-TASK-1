## INTERNSHIP OVERVIEW OF TASK 1

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Overview
Objective: The goal of the EDA is to understand the data, identify any patterns, relationships, or anomalies, and prepare the data for modeling.

### Steps Involved:

#### Loading the Dataset:

The dataset is loaded using Pandas. It contains columns like price, area, bedrooms, bathrooms, stories, mainroad, guestroom, basement, hotwaterheating, airconditioning, parking, prefarea, and furnishingstatus.

#### Checking for Missing Values:

The dataset is inspected for any missing values to ensure data completeness.

#### Summary Statistics:

Descriptive statistics of the dataset are computed to understand the distribution and basic statistics (mean, median, etc.) of the features.

#### Correlation Matrix:

A correlation matrix is plotted to visualize the relationships between different variables. This helps in identifying which variables are most strongly correlated with the target variable (price).

#### Pairplot:

Pairplots are generated to visualize pairwise relationships between variables, aiding in understanding interactions between features.

#### Distribution Analysis:

The distribution of the target variable (price) is plotted to check for skewness or unusual patterns.

#### Visualizations:

##### Correlation Heatmap: Highlights the correlation between features using color gradients.

##### Pairplot: Shows scatter plots for pairwise feature combinations, providing insights into variable relationships.

##### Histogram of House Prices: Displays the distribution of house prices, indicating the central tendency and spread of the data.
